# Migration Skills

A family of skills that migrate existing deployments from other cloud platforms to [CreateOS](https://createos.nodeops.network).

Each migration skill reads the source platform's configuration, maps it to CreateOS equivalents, provisions environments and environment variables, and triggers the first deployment via the CreateOS MCP server. Skills do not modify or delete anything on the source platform — your existing deployment stays live until you cut DNS over.

> **Note on naming:** The `skills` CLI in this repository uses a flat layout (`skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`). All migration skills are named `<platform>-to-createos` and live as siblings under `skills/`, not under a `migrate/` subdirectory.
