### Migration skills

`vercel-to-createos` and `netlify-to-createos` are shipped migration skills. Stubs for `railway-to-createos`, `heroku-to-createos`, `render-to-createos`, and `flyio-to-createos` are reserved and route users to the concierge migration path until they ship. See [MIGRATIONS.md](./MIGRATIONS.md) for the full list and roadmap.

### Agent migration skills

`claude-code-to-codex` migrates Claude Code CLI setups to Codex CLI, with focused coverage for hooks, Claude Code CLI MCP servers, plugins, and session handoff.

## CreateOS Authentication

The `createos` skill can be used in two modes:

- MCP mode (preferred when available): authentication is handled by the MCP server (no API key needed).
- REST/script mode: you must provide an API key via `CREATEOS_API_KEY`.

For REST/script usage:

```bash
export CREATEOS_API_KEY="<your-createos-api-key>"
```

Never commit API keys to git; prefer setting them in your shell or your agent environment.

## Installation

```bash
