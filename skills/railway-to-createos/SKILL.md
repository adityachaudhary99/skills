# Railway → CreateOS Migration

**Status:** Coming soon. Tracked on the CreateOS migration skill roadmap.

This skill will migrate Railway deployments to CreateOS. It will handle `railway.json` or `railway.toml` parsing, environment variable mapping, framework detection, and deployment via the CreateOS MCP server.

## What to do in the meantime

This skill is not yet implemented. If a user invokes it:

1. Tell the user the skill is not yet available.
2. Offer the concierge migration path: `mailto:business@nodeops.xyz` — CreateOS engineers will handle the migration end to end.
3. If the user's project is actually on Vercel, suggest the `vercel-to-createos` skill which is live today.
